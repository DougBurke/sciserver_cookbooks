This directory is a place to collect helpful Jupyter notebooks specifically
designed for HEASARC@SciServer.  We include

* rxte_example_lightcurves.ipynb:  an example of light curve extraction
* rxte_example_spectral.ipynb:  an example of spectral extraction
* data_access.ipynb:  a discussion of how to access data on SciServer
* demo_rxte_ml.ipynb:  a quick example of Machine Learning on Eta Car RXTE light curves.
